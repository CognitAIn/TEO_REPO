﻿# \# 🧠 EcoCode / TEO — The Homeostatic Computing Framework  

# \*\*Δ + 1 Harmonic Control · Self-Regulating Systems · Cognitive-Inspired Equilibrium\*\*

# 

# ---

# 

# \## Overview

# EcoCode / TEO introduces a new class of computing systems that maintain \*\*homeostatic equilibrium\*\* between performance, power, and thermal load — a dynamic balance modeled after biological feedback systems.

# 

# Instead of chasing peak throughput or short-term optimization, \*\*EcoCode’s Δ + 1 harmonic controller\*\* continuously regulates computational energy flow, minimizing oscillations and thermal drift while maintaining stability under chaotic workloads.

# 

# This repository serves as the official \*\*public reference implementation and proof of discovery\*\* for harmonic, equilibrium-based computing architectures.

# 

# All operational program files, including the core framework, are located in the \[`src/`](./src) directory.

#

# 

# \## 🔬 Core Concept — Harmonic Balance in Computing

# Traditional optimization systems (PID, Adam, RMSProp, etc.) prioritize rapid convergence.  

# \*\*TEO\*\* instead seeks \*sustained equilibrium\*, where the system self-corrects with minimal overshoot and oscillation.

# 

# \### Objective Function

# \\\[

# J = \\sum\_t \[ L(t) + λP(t) + βVar(L\_t) ]

# \\]

# 

# Where:

# \- \*\*L(t)\*\* = Latency at time \*t\*  

# \- \*\*P(t)\*\* = Power consumption  

# \- \*\*Var(Lₜ)\*\* = Latency variance (jitter)  

# \- \*\*λ, β\*\* = Tunable control weights  

# 

# \### Δ + 1 Harmonic Feedback Law

# \\\[

# u\_t = clip(K·e\_t, −α·Δ\_{t−1}, α·Δ\_{t−1})

# \\]

# 

# Each correction is \*\*bounded by the prior deviation\*\*, preventing runaway instability and creating smooth, resilient homeostatic control curves.

# \## 🧩 Architecture Overview

# | Layer | Module | Description |

# |:--|:--|:--|

# | Core Substrate | `TGO\_Substrate/` | Energy token routing and adaptive resource allocation |

# | Loops Engine | `loops/` | Recursive harmonic feedback and diagnostics |

# | Launcher | `TGO\_Launcher.py` | Entry point and UI (bypassed in test mode) |

# | Trinity Core | `run\_trinity.py` | Central recursive orchestration and self-learning loop |

# | GPU Suite | `trinity\_gpu/` | Low-level adaptive GPU controllers for compute equilibrium |

# 

# All source code resides in the \*\*\[`src/`](./src)\*\* directory.  

# Each module operates as a harmonic subsystem, exchanging energy and error signals to maintain balance across CPU/GPU workloads.
