# Statement of Discovery — EcoCode Solutions

**Inventor:** Mark T. Burks  
**Entity:** EcoCode Solutions  
**Date:** 2025-10-31  

EcoCode introduces a proprietary architecture based on homeostatic system design, balancing computational demand and energy expenditure.  
The framework defines harmonic feedback loops and self-correcting protocols for latency, power, and thermal stability.

### Protected Components
- Delta + 1 Harmonic Balancing  
- Adaptive Energy Flow Protocol (AEFP)  
- Biomorphic System Design  
- OmniCode Linguistic Framework (Ψ notation, recursive mapping, fractal compression)
